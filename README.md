# First project tech (Drink & Date)

In my web application it will be possible to connect with someone through drinks based on their likes.
The user can use his/her Untappd account to enter the site. This webapplication will seach someone with the same interests in beer.
There will be a function that connects the users and will look at the same similarities.

When two users like the same beers & they like eachother they will be a match.
